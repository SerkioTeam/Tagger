Serkio Tagger
=============


What does this do?
------------------

Serkio tagger makes it easy to manually create tags that span a time frame in
a video. Currently, most tools only do top-level tagging like genre and cast
lists. But what if you want to tag something more detailed? Like which scenes
have a certain movie star having an argument while wearing a hat. Or scenes
containing songs by a certain artist. Or teapots. Or thunderstorms. Or tigers.
Orâ€¦ almost anything, really. If it happens in the video, you can tag it.


Who's this for?
---------------

Movie buffs, celeb fans, trivia lovers, video producers, marketers,
journalists, researchers.
